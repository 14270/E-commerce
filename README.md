I developed an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to browse and add clothing items to their cart. The website features a dynamic shopping cart where users can select the quantity of items, view the total price in real time, and update or remove products as needed. JavaScript was used to handle cart functionality, price calculations, and interactive UI elements, ensuring a smooth userÂ experience.
